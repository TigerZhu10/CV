                Hi, I'm Tiger Zhu (HongLe Zhu). I'm an international student who loves computers and coding. I enjoy learning about new technology and creating cool projects that solve problems.
                When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing basketball. It's a sport I love because it keeps me active and helps me work well with others as a team. On this website,
                I'll share my coding projects and some of the things I've learned along the way. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my site!
