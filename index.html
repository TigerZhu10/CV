                    Hi, I'm Tiger Zhu (HongLe Zhu). I'm an international student who loves computers and coding. I enjoy learning about new technology and creating cool projects that solve problems.
                    When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing basketball. It's a sport I love because it keeps me active and helps me work well with others as a team. On this website,
                    I'll share my coding projects and some of the things I've learned along the way. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my site!

                    The Arduino Alarm Clock is a beginner-friendly project that helped me learn arrays, for loops, millis(), state machines, and circuit connections. It features real-time display, alarm setting, and a buzzer that sounds at the set time. 
                    The project required components like an Arduino Uno, 7-segment display, buzzer, push button, resistors, and jumper wires. Through this project, I improved my Arduino programming and circuit design skills.
                    It was a great hands-on experience in both coding and electronics.
